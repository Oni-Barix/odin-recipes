         <p>This protein packed banana bread will become a staple meal during any bulk after you try it just once! Here's what you'll need.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Kodiak Banana mix</li>
            <li>3 eggs</li>
            <li>1 cup of milk</li>
            <li>1/3 cup of cooking oil of choice</li>
            <li>Vanilla protein powder</li>
         </ol>
         <p>The process for this is rather simple even if you have never cooked before. To start lets preheat the oven to 350f. While it is warming up we will mix in all of our ingredients into a mixing bowl.
            I heavily recommend a mixer, but if not hand mixing will be okay. Mix everything together into a nice even coating. There should be no visible lumps in the mix. Now pour the mix into a bread pan with the mix coming roughly halfway up the pan
            when settled. Not place the pan into the middle rack on the oven and give it about 20 minutes. After 20 minutes rotate the pan so that the side that was facing you is now facing the back of the oven. Give it another 20 before pulling.
            The best way to tell your bread is done is to give it the "toothpick test." This test is simple. Poke the bread with a toothpick roughly halfway into the bread. If the toothpick is clean it is done. A few crumbs is okay, but if the toothpick
            looks gritty or has lots of wet looking crumbs it is not ready. I personally prefer my bread on the thicker side so I cut into 6 to 8 slices but cut however you see fit and enjoy!
