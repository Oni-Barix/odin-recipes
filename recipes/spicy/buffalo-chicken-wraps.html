         <p>A household favorite for me. This wrap is guaranteed to be a hit with you and anyone you serve. This is what we will need today.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Tortilla shells</li>
            <li>Lean chicken breast</li>
            <li>Zesty ranch sauce</li>
            <li>Buffalo sauce</li>
            <li>lettuce</li>
            <li>White or Brown Onion</li>
         </ol>
         <p>To start with this meal first we want to dice up the chicken. Make sure to cut into even pieces so it will all cook evenly later. Now that the chicken is cut add any spices you want into it and the Buffalo sauce of your choice. While this sits
            and marinades we can get a pan preheated with our oil of choice as well as cutting up with the lettuce and onions into pieces. For the lettuce I like to do small strips of romaine but really any will do. As for the onions I dice and quarter them.
            Now that the veggies are done, are chicken has had time to marinade, and the pan is hot lets add in our onions. For this I am just aiming to get a bit transparent because we'll be adding in our chicken shortly. Once the onions are ready we add said
            chicken and let those cook together till the chicken is done. Next we get a new pan and put the heat on low. Take a tortilla shell and place it in the new pan letting it get warm. Next take the shell out, put a ranch base on it and add your chicken
            onion, and lettuce into the shell. Give it a good hold and place it back in the pan with the opening down onto the heat first to help it hold its shape. once the shell is done you are free to plate and serve as you wish and be sure to enjoy!
