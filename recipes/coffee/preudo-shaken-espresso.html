        <h1>Pseudo Shaken Espresso</h1>
        <!-- <img src="" alt="A glass cup of coffee sits on a wooden board ready to drink"> -->
         <p>This is a daily brew for me and there are so many ways to make it! This is how I make mine every morning</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Coffee of choice</li>
            <li>Bullet, nugget, chipped, or shaved ice</li>
            <li>A shaker cup or cocktail shaker</li>
            <li>milk</li>
            <li>(optional) chocolate powder </li>
         </ol>
         <p>Before we progress I want to say the following. Make the coffee however you want! Want to do a french press? Go for it, cold brew? It'll work! Straight from the coffee pot? If that's how you wanna do it! <em>I actually
            use instant coffee and it's still wonderful</em> Okay, we have our coffee brewing and now we can make the sides. Warm up some milk however you need to. If you have a way to steam or texture the milk do so it will help make a smoother coffee.
            Fill your shaking method with ice. The perfect amount varies per amount of beverage but the way you can tell after experimenting is you will have a cold beverage but there will no longer be any large ice pieces left. This is something you can 
            hear and feel when shaking later. Next combine your coffee and milk into the shaker. Add anything you wish to add into the drink itself such as sugar, creatine, or a pinch of salt (I heavily recommend a pinch of salt.) Give it a good shake
            and pour into your cup of choice. The absolute last step if you want to do it is to add chocolate powder to the top of the foam layer. Less is more with this as it will give the coffee a chocolate tone to it as well as looking even more interesting.
            I hope you enjoy!
