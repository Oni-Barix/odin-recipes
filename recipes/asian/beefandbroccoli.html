         <p>Beef and Broccoli is a staple for any Asian restaurant I have ever been to. A simple dish stir fried in a sauce to make it both a healthy meal as well as delicious. To make this meal we will need the following ingredients.</p>
         <ol>
            <li>Broccoli florets</li>
            <li>Lean beef (Not ground)</li>
            <li>Stir Fry sauce</li>
            <li>Cooking oil of choice</li>
         </ol>
         <p>Making this meal is easy! First you want to put some cooking oil, I personally use Avocado in your pan and get it nice and hot. After that goes in the Broccoli with just a pinch of salt. Not much though because the sauce will have soy.
            After you add the Broccoli you want to make sure it is nicely spread out to make sure it cooks evenly. Add just a bit of water to keep the broccoli from scorching and cover this for roughly 10 minutes. After about 10 minutes or until the broccoli
            is done but still has a bit of a bite to it take it out and place it off to the side for later. Next were going to add in our beef as well as our seasonings. Same as last time make sure it is evenly spaced out so it all cooked evenly. 
            I like to let the beef sit for about 3 minutes on one side before giving it a flip. Do this until the beef is done but not overdone as you will have a tough texture to it. Now we will add back in our broccoli as well as our sauce. For this last part reduce the heat and stir fry this
            all together until the sauce starts to thicken. After that you can add some sesame seeds for a bit of garnish, or not it doesn't matter, but now you are ready to plate, serve, and enjoy!</p>
