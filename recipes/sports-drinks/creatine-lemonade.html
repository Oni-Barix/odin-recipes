         <p>A drink so good it's sitting next to me as I am typing this. This is what you'll need</p>
         <ol>
            <li>lemonade</li>
            <li>creatine</li>
            <li>shaker cup</li>
            <li>ice</li>
         </ol>
         <p>This drink is beyond easy to make and quick too! If you already have lemonade feel free to use that. If not you can use the powdered version and follow its serving size based on its instructions. In my case I use Ryse BCAA lemonade mix with
            12oz of water. Combine this with 5 grams of Creatine (Use Optimum Nutrition Blueberry lemonade for extra flavor.) Add in as much or as little ice as you want into your shaker bottle and blend it all together. Yes it really is that simple and 
            the taste is as good as the lemonade you use. I know healthy and quick don't always go together but this is one of those exceptions! I hope you enjoy this as much as I do, I drink this year round in an insulated shaker cup so that way I can always enjoy!
