        <!-- <img src="" alt="A steaming plate of Chicken alfredo waiting to be eaten"> -->
         <p>A classic dish that is as delicious as it is simple. To make this dish you will need the following.</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Pasta noodles of choice</li>
                <li>Cooking oil</li>
                <li>Lean chicken breast</li>
                <li>Alfredo sauce</li>
                <li>Spices of choice</li>
            </ol>
        <p>This is a tried and true dish that is always a hit. In order to make it well start by adding some cooking oil to a pan and placing it on a medium to low heat. While our
            pan is heating up now is a great time to start getting our chicken ready. Start by cutting the chicken into even pieces. I prefer to cut mine into smaller bits so they
            blend well with the noodles. Now that the chicken is cut up it's time to spice it. I like to do salt, pepper garlic, onion, paprika, and either some chilli
            or cajun seasoning to give it some kick. Now that we are nice and flavored toss the chicken into our preheated pan. Let the chicken sit for about two minuets 
            before giving it a stir so it gets a nice bit of color on it. Cook until it is done then set it aside for later. Next add our noodles into some boiling water and 
            don't forget the salt! Let the noodles cook for about ten to 12 minuets so they get that nice al-dante taste and strain them. Next well add our chicken and noodles 
            back together into the same pan and add our sauce. We're just waiting on our sauce to get warm and thicken at this point but it's a good time to add in seasonings again 
            to help everything blend in better. Like last time I am going to add salt, pepper, garlic, onion, and whatever heat I am going with this time. Additionally I like to add
            parsley in too for a bit of garnish as well as just enjoying the taste of it. Once the sauce has thickened she is ready to be plated and enjoy!
