Hello there! This is a collection of various recipes I have found across the web or have developed myself through my interests in cooking. This site will be a simple website to showcase my HTML & git knowledge acquired while studying via The Odin Project. 

Planned features:

1. Creation categories in both the homepage as well as creating HTML files for the following: Asian, Baked-goods, Coffee, Italian, Southern, Spicy, Sports-drinks. Beginnings will have one of each category and build form there. (Beef and broccoli, Kodiak quick banana bread, pseudo shaken espresso, Chicken Alfredo, Buffalo chick wraps, Creatine lemonade.)

2. Filling out the recipe html files with the needed information to start making said items.

3. Filling out remaining details of all pages such as adding photos w/ alts.

4. continuation of the lists w/ more recipes across the various categories.
